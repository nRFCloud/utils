# nRF Cloud Utilities

This repository contains scripts that support certain use cases of nRF Cloud, mainly endpoints in [the REST API](https://api.nrfcloud.com/v1).

The scripts are gathered from various teams and organized according to their programmatic language: [Python](https://github.com/nRFCloud/utils/tree/master/python/modem-firmware-1.3%2B) and [TypeScript](https://github.com/nRFCloud/utils/tree/master/node-ts). We cannot, at this time, offer the same scripts across all languages.

Please see the README in each folder for more information pertaining to each language.

See also the official [nRF Cloud documentation](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrf-cloud/page/index.html).
